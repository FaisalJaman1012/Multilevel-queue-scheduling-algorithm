Here it is a Program for multilevel queue scheduling algorithm. where three queues are generated. they are specific range of priority associated with every queue.then we prompt the user to enter number of process along with their priority and burst time. here each process occupy the respective queue with specific priority range according to its priority. we have applied Robin algorithm with quantum time 3 on queue with highest priority range. we also applied priority scheduling algorithm on the queue with medium range of priority and SJF algorithm on the queue with lowest range of Priority. Each and every queue should have a quantum time of 10 seconds. CPU will keep on shifting between queues after every 10 seconds.
